God designed His Church to be a fellowship—not just a community, but a family of brothers and sisters who share God’s ideals and beliefs 
(Ephesians 2:19-22). Our Church brethren can help us improve ourselves—for “as iron sharpens iron, a friend sharpens a friend” (Proverbs 27:17, New Living Translation).
