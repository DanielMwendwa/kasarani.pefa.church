This comes from the Book of Acts and the event of Pentecost, where early Christians received the gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as prophecy and healing. Acts 2 says, “When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.”
