1. We value the Holy Scripture as the inerrant, inspired Word of God for instruction in living and direction into a person, life-transforming relationship with Jesus Christ as Lord.

2. We value the unconditional love of God which was manifested in the redemptive work accomplished on the cross by His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Spirit's drawing men to God Himself.

3. We value intercessory prayer, believer's baptism, complete stewardship before God, and the use of spiritual gifts for the edification of the church.

4. We value the responsibility of being called into a royal priesthood with the express charge of calling our fellowman into a faith-based grace-provided relationship with Jesus Christ.

5. We value the freedom to gather in worship using our spiritual gifts, prayer, song, praise, and thanksgiving as demonstrated in the preaching and teaching of the Bible.

6. We value our unity as the body of Christ, enjoying one another's diversity and uniqueness, joining in fellowship with one another in worship and prayer, reaching out and meeting members' needs with compassion and love for all ages.

7. We value honesty and integrity, personal responsibility and accountability to God, self-discipline, respect for all human life from conception to natural death, and diligence in our daily walk.

8. We value cooperating with other churches of like precious faith in evangelistic and missionary endeavors.

9. We value sharing the gospel and the discipleship of all ages including children, youth, adults, and senior adults.

10. We value the democratic freedoms of choice and process in our church's decision-making.
