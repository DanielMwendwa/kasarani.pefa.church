Grace is the unmerited favor of God: it is a special ability given to the born again Christian to get things easily from God and to get things easily done. Grace cannot be purchased or borrowed; it is a gift of God. It is a gift that the Lord Jesus Christ gave to all men, especially those who believe in Him **(John 1:17)**. Grace was given to all men to give mankind the opportunity to be saved; that is why the Law of Moses has been abolished. The Law of Moses would have put many people to death if grace had not been given to mankind. The law gave instant justice to sin without room for repentance, but grace gives mankind the room to repent and be saved. After being saved you can ask for more grace to accomplish a particular task, but without the saving grace God will not listen to your prayer because you are not His child. Dear beloved, are you saved? If you are not, take advantage of the saving grace and get saved so that you can enjoy the inheritance of God. Hallelujah
